This is my first blog post ever hosted on github pages. Setting up this blog is actually really easy using Jykell. I just followed the steps outlined [here](https://pages.github.com/).

Is this the beginning of something big? Will this buy me some motivation? Or will I just neglect this website and forget about everything here? Only time will tell. Congratz on being one of the few people to read this.
